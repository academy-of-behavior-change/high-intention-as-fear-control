# Reporting a high intention as fear control strategy

This is the GitHub repository for a project to test the hypothesis that people who need to engage in fear control use self-report measures of intention to decrease their fear: by reporting a high intention to change their behavior, their fear decreases, but this high intention does not reflect their actual intention. In other words, self-reports are not a valid operationalisation of intention in situations where participants have a motivation to decrease their experienced fear.

The Open Science Framework project page for this project is [https://osf.io/mncu9/](https://osf.io/mncu9/). This project is a part of the "Towards consensus on fear appeals" project that is hosted on the Open Science Framework at [https://osf.io/a2v46/](https://osf.io/a2v46/).
