# Reporting a high intention as a fear control strategy

This is the GitHub repository for a project to test the hypothesis that reporting a high intention can be used as a fear control strategy. If this hypothesis is correct, self-reports of intention are not valid operationalisations of the theoretical construct intention in participants engaging in fear control, such as after being exposed to a threatening communication under low efficacy conditions.

The Open Science Framework project page for this project is [https://osf.io/m8k5j/](https://osf.io/m8k5j/). This project is a part of the "Towards consensus on fear appeals" project that is hosted on the Open Science Framework at [https://osf.io/a2v46/](https://osf.io/a2v46/).
